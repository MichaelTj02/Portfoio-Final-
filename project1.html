                In the Fall of 2023, I took IAT267 and was assigned a final 
                project in groups of 4 to create a smart home device, health 
                monitoring device or an educational toy for children. Multiple 
                sensor usage was mandatory, powered by Arduino Microcontroller 
                and Processing to display the user interface. My group and I 
                decided to make an educational toy for children called E-Hop, 
                a digital iteration of the traditional hopscotch game.

            <p>
                We as a group decided to go with E-Hop because we found that 
                the first five years of a child are the most crucial stage for 
                physical development. Moreover, five to six percent of children, 
                which amounts to two children in every classroom in Canada, are 
                affected by Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) or Dyspraxia. 
                It is a condition where children are severely uncoordinated for 
                their age. Through E-Hop, we aim to provide early intervention to 
                minimize the risk of getting DCD for children prone to the disease 
                in a fun and educative method.

                I am responsible for choosing which sensors to use to build the device. 
                Initially, I planned on using a force sensor to register input given by 
                the user, however, after a discussion with my instructor, he recommended 
                using Velostat, a pressure-sensitive conductive sheet.

                    <p>Our approach to making games is to find the fun first
                        and then use the technology to enhance the fun.
