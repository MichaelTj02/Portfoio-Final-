            <p>
                In the Fall of 2023, I took IAT267 and was assigned a final
                project in groups of 4 to create a smart home device, health
                monitoring device or an educational toy for children. Multiple
                sensor usage was mandatory, powered by Arduino Microcontroller
                and Processing to display the user interface. My group and I
                decided to make an educational toy for children called E-Hop,
                a digital iteration of the traditional hopscotch game.

            <p>
                We as a group decided to go with E-Hop because we found that
                the first five years of a child are the most crucial stage for
                physical development. Moreover, five to six percent of children,
                which amounts to two children in every classroom in Canada, are
                affected by Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) or Dyspraxia.
                It is a condition where children are severely uncoordinated for
                their age. Through E-Hop, we aim to provide early intervention to
                minimize the risk of getting DCD for children prone to the disease
                in a fun and educative method.

                the user, however, after a discussion with my instructor, he recommended
                using Velostat, a pressure-sensitive conductive sheet.

                Now that the prototype is fully working, I, with my groupmate's

                board. I ensured the overall build quality was sturdy enough not
                to break when the user stepped on it.

                The next step is while my groupmates design the user interface,
                I am responsible for code development in Processing. This
                involves creating levels, reading sensor inputs, and generating
                interactions based on user feedback, such as buzzer sounds and
                level progressions.

                The project is a success, and many students, including instructors,
                visit my booth to give it a shot. Many improvements could be made in
                the input and sensors, but I am delighted with the end product.
                Interactivity with the users matters most, and I successfully achieved
                it through my work.

                With all the time given and the research my group and I did, this project
                was a success, and I am very proud of it. I can add more output to improve
                the installation, such as lights or buzzers, to show users whether the mat
                recognizes their feedback. Still, with the time restrictions and
                unfamiliarity of the velostat, I am pleased with me and my group's work.
