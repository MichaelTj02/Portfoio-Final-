                <p>
                    In Spring 2022, I took IAT265 course and was tasked to create a
                    multimedia app for my final project. It must be an interactive
                    multimedia simulation demonstrating a process in an environment,
                    with user interactivity being the primary focus. Java was used
                    as the programming language, with Eclipse as its IDE
                    (Integrated Development Environment).

            <div class="about-section-text-grid">
                <p>
                    The content of the multimedia app must have an end goal and can
                    range from story-based simulation to procedural guides such as
                    growing plants. There needs to be a variety of animations and
                    sound effects throughout the user's journey. With these requirements,
                    I need to think of an exciting topic that can be integrated with lots
                    of user interactivity and can be achieved in Java.

                    I was thinking of a star wars-based story to destroy the death star
                    or a procedural type that guides users to make ice cream. After
                    recapping the topics I learned throughout the course, I decided to
                    create steps to build a parfait. To provide visual appeal, matcha
                    type of parfait is chosen due to the colours it offers.

                <p class="p-right">
                    First, I need to develop the story and how to reach the end goal. 
                    The intro, introduction, and end screens are mandatory for all 
                    kinds of multimedia apps for users to get started and finish. For 
                    the parfait, it involves creating ice cream and toppings to 
                    complete, and I have to figure out the process involved in between.

                <h2 class="about-title-left">Drawing Elements</h2>
                <p class="p-left">
                    Drawing elements is the next part. Since there are animations in 
                    the app, I have to draw multiple iterations of the same objects, 
                    such as the parfait glass starting from empty to the finished 
                    state. Cereal boxes also need an animation when it is pouring, 
                    so I have to make multiple drawings.

                <p class="p-right">
                    Since this is a procedural type of app, there will be multiple 
                    stages to get to the final goal and in Java, we translate this 
                    to states. Each state will have different animations, and the 
                    parfait glass will have to be drawn differently according to 
                    its current step. As seen in the image, states will have different 
                    types of objects drawn, and in every state progression, code 
                    runs behind to control and choose which iteration of the things 
                    should be drawn.

                <h2 class="about-title-left">Final Testing</h2>
                <p class="p-left">
                    Last but not least, I put the instructions at the bottom of the 
                    screen to instruct users on what to do. Besides that, final testing 
                    is made to check whether the code and the objects work coherently. 
                    Through this process, I am trying to find if bugs exist and find the 
                    problem in the code to fix it. Final adjustments are also made to the 
                    sound effects to sync better with the interactions.

                    This project taught me a lot in the game environment, introducing me 
                    to the states syntax to track user progression. Overall, the project 
                    is a success, although there are areas of improvement, such as creating 
                    object movements to make it more interactive and appealing.
